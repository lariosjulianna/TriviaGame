# TriviaGame

Welcome to Trivia Game, a simple Python command-line application that allows users to play a trivia game.

## Overview

The Trivia Game presents users with trivia questions and prompts them to select the correct answer from a list of options. The game keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback on each answer.

## Features

- Multiple-choice trivia questions
- Score tracking
- Command-line interface

## Installation 
To run this code, ensure that you have Python3 downloaded.

To run Trivia Game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TriviaGame.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd TriviaGame`
3. Run the Python script: `python3 trivia.py`

## Issues To Fix
1. Implement a timer feature to add a time constraint to each question.
2. Implement a high score tracking. Create a leaderboard for the high scores, then display it at the end of the game.
3. Expand the Trivia Game by adding categories. Allow the user to choose a specific category (science, history, sports, etc.)
4. Implement lives for the user. If they get a question wrong, they lose a life; the game is over once they lose 3 lives.
5. Add lifelines for users to use when they are stuck on a question. Example: 50/50 - removes two answer options, gives the user a hint, etc.
