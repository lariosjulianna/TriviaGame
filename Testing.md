# Testing

### Overview
Testing is an essential part of the development process that helps verify the correctness and robustness of our code. 
In this project, we use unit tests to validate individual components and functionalities of the trivia game.

### Running Tests
To run the unit tests for the trivia game, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the test script (test_trivia.py) is located.
3. Run the test script using the following command: python3 trivia_test.py
4. After running the unit tests, you will see the test results displayed in the terminal.
   If all tests pass, you will see an output indicating that all tests were successful. If any tests fail,
   you will see output indicating which tests failed and why. If a test fails, carefully review the failure
   message and make necessary adjustments to your code to fix the issue. Once the issue is resolved, rerun
   the tests to ensure that the problem has been resolved.
